## Idea

To accelerate scientific discovery, we need to identify a large number of compounds with high precision. 
MS/MS can do that. Going from spectrum to molecule is hard, 90% of the molecule spectra are unknown.

We think that requires three pillars: high-resolution prediction, interpretability, and incorporating large-scale unlabelled spectra data.
In the current version, [FraGNNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02360) accurately predicts high-resolution spectra. FraGNNet also offers interpretability through annoting peaks with their possible fragmentation paths.
In the next step we want to incorporate [DreaMS](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6626775021291e5d1d61967f), which contains information from 1000x times more data from unlabeled spectra.

## More details to come
We are working on a fleshed-out version of MSEffect that includes DreaMS. Stay tuned!
